# Notes on how to create a release #

## Versioning ##
Versioning must follow the x.x.x format, breaking changes should be a major release.  
When publishing a release, tag the release with the exact version number, the New Version check performs an exact string match against the latest tag and if different shows the prompt.  
Provisional releases are still shown as an available new version.  
To publish a beta release that you do not want to be shown as available to all users suffix beta to the tag, x.x.xbeta
